Short Answer: This is under the GPL.

* A method and aparatus for writing a mutlithreaded internet server.

* Also a method and aparatus for simulating a real live SMTP server.
  (smtpsink)

* Also included: gr (generic_resource), a method and aparatus for
  tracking and releasing resources semi-automatically. This is part
  of libserver.

Compiles cleanly (modulo a couple of annoying warnings) on my box:
Linux chalco 2.2.17pre20 #20 Sun Aug 27 01:35:48 EDT 2000 i586 unknown

The latest version should be available at <http://www3.50megs.com/adsgray/>

SMTP specific:
Currently is hardcoded to handle 35 simultaneous connections to port
2525 and do not much.  
A "info" server is started on port 2552 which you can telnet to and type
"info" into to get some stats about the SMTP server. Could add a "kill"
command that will kill the SMTP server. (Done, but not cleanly).
You can use the "info server" to set the frequency of random SMTP errors.

HTTP:
http_driver is a simple HTTP server which services static page
requests only.

Future:
I'd like to write an http_server (and ftp_server, and ...) to go along
with the existing smtp_server.

Maybe a port-forwarding load balancer too... which is configurable with
a web browser.

Maybe ability to look at smtpsink info/stats with a webbrowser.

grep the code for "TODO".
