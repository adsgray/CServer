A method and aparatus for writing a mutlithreaded internet server.
Also a method and aparatus for simulating a real live SMTP server.

SMTP specific:
Currently is hardcoded to handle 35 simultaneous connections to port
25 and do nothing.  Framework is in place to add random 4xx/5xx error
responses as well as random dropped connections, with statistics tracking
each time this happens.

A "info" server is started on port 2552 which you can telnet to and type
"info" into to get some stats about the SMTP server.

General framework:
I'd like to write a http_server (and ftp_server, and ...) to go along
with the existing smtp_server.

Maybe a port-forwarding load balancer too... which is configurable with
a web browser.
